- Your deliverable must work and contains instructions on how to build and run it.
- Implement it like you'll do it for a real-life project in term of quality and tooling.
- Use as few dependenciees as possible.
- No backend is required (no real api or database) but you can mock or simulate it if you want a datasource.

NOTE: We'll use a ubuntu-like system to test your deliverable. Ensure it'll work on this context!

- Ship a git-bundle package of your repository with all elements (code, doc, tooling...). Pack this bundle as you would do with the Paylead git repository.
